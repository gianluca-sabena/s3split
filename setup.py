    # Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
    # 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this

    # syntax, for example:
    #
    #   $ pip install sampleproject[dev]

    # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # installed, specify them here.
    #
    # Sometimes youâ€™ll want to use packages that are properly arranged with
    # setuptools, but are not published to PyPI. In those cases, you can specify
    # a list of one or more dependency_links URLs where the package can
    # be downloaded, along with some additional hints, and setuptools
    # will find and install the package correctly.

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    entry_points={"console_scripts": ["s3split=s3split.main:run_cli"]},
